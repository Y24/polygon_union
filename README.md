# Introduction

## About

This program is aimed to solve the polygon union problem.
It's mainly copied from this website [一点心青博客园【计算几何】多边形交集](https://www.cnblogs.com/dwdxdy/p/3232110.html) and has been rewriten by me.

## Usage

- Compile the target c++ source file.

```code
    cd `dir`
    g++ l.cpp
```

- Run
  - Without any arguemnts, then The program will read data from `std::cin`.
  
  - With argument `-h`, then the program will display some help info.

  - Otherwise, the program will try to read data from the file named by the first argument.

## Note

- Still remains some unkown bugs, but too lazy to continue.

- Hope would work.
